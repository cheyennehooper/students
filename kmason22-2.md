# Assignment 2: Project Idea
## Keller Mason

### Proposal Summary: 

The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly website or app that
collects and provides information on nearby charities and non-profit
organizations. As society progresses more and more in technological integration,
people are seeking a way to contribute to their communities. Often, finding
information on said charities and non-profits can be challenging. In an effort
to bridge that gap, I want to make a convenient and comprehensive platform for
those that wish to make their impact.

One of the major features that I plan to include is a searching function where
users can filter by cause category, location, and the specific type of help
needed by each organization. The website will generate a dedicated page for
each of the organizations that will include contact information, donation links,
and a mission statement. In addition to this, there will be a section of
upcoming events that are available for volunteers for each charity or
non-profit. This will provide a hands-on method of contribution to the user.
Something I am also thinking about adding is links to social media or
newsletters for the organizations. If the user ends up really liking a
particular organization, they can follow them through the links provided.

My idea for the design of the project is to priotize simplicity and minimalism.
I want every user to have a positive experience because they are trying to do
something positive for their community. In the short term, our group could
expect to be researching local organizations, building a mutable database, and
designing a visually appealing interface the bleeds ease of use. In short, the
long term goal of this project is to create a closer local community in the
areas that choose to use the software.

### Problem:

Many people are not aware of the ways that they can contribute to their local
community. In order to provide them with that awareness, I want to create a
convenient piece of software that allows them to find said ways to contribute.
